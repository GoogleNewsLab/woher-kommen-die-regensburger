# Woher kommen die Regensburger

[Live Version](http://stories.mittelbayerische.de/interaktiv/woher-kommen-die-regensburger)

Within the framework of the Google News Lab Fellowship, I tried to answers the question from where people moved to the city of Regensburg. As a result, I developed a map application for the Mittelbayerische Zeitung in Regensburg which gives the user the possibility to find out how many people moved into the city over the last six years. 

This application not only contains options like searching for different cities but further enables everyone to observe the continuous movement out of every town to Regensburg. The whole map is embedded into a journalistic article, which describes general movement developments into the city itself based on a federal and international level. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
